This is a web page in the way of a video game. It is a grid of squares in where are pieces of fruit that are eated by a snake. 
The snake fills squares in the grid as it grows eating. The way the game ends is to hit a wall in the border of the grid or to hit a square of the snake itself. As the snake eats the speed is increased.
